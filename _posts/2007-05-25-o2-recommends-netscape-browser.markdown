I went to O2 today to look at phones and was greeted by this:[![o2 recommends](http://static.squarespace.com/static/50fbdd03e4b09c7c8a79f7ae/50fbdd87e4b075d7a3c11a69/50fbdd87e4b075d7a3c11a72/1180117067000/picture-1.jpg?format=original)](http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=513679978&size=o)
Apparently O2 doesn't like the beta version of Camino, so recommends Netscape? That's just f**ked up
