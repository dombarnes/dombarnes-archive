I saw these a while back and being a new blog had to stick them up. Merlin Mann is a hilarious guy. He does [MacBreak Weekly](http://twit.tv/mbw), runs [43 Folders](http://www.43folders.com), [5ives](http://wwww.5ives.com), as well as his day job. Check out all the [phone guy](http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=merlinmann) videos.
